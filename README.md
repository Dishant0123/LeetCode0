JavaScript is a powerful and versatile programming language that is mainly used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. It runs directly in the browser, allowing developers to create features such as form validation, animations, dynamic content updates, and interactive user interfaces without reloading the page. JavaScript works seamlessly with HTML and CSS, forming the core technologies of modern web development. Over time, JavaScript has evolved beyond the browser and is now widely used in server-side development (with Node.js), mobile app development, game development, and even machine learning. Its event-driven nature, large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, and strong community support make JavaScript one of the most popular and essential languages for developers today.
I don’t just solve problems on LeetCode.
I train my thinking.

Every failed submission teaches me something new.
Every optimized solution feels like progress.

I enjoy breaking problems into patterns,
finding edge cases,
and turning logic into clean, efficient code.

Coding is not about memorizing solutions.
It’s about consistency, curiosity, and discipline.
